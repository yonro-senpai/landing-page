Landing Page | Second Project | The Odin Project | Learning Web Development
## Description
This site showcases projects I’ve built while following The Odin Project curriculum and exploring modern web technologies.  
Started this site’s code with the Odin Project landing page exercise and expanded it into a full profile page. It contains my personal projects and social media links—feel free to use it as a template to create your own profile page.  
Thank you for visiting—every keystroke is a step forward on the journey to becoming a great developer!
